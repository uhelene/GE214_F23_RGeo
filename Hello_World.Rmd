This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# You can delete everything above this.
## Let's make a new section here with a level 1 header labeled something like "Worcester Election Data"
- use rmarkdown to create the section header 
- use rmarkdown to make a link that indicates where we got the data: https://gisdata.worcesterma.gov/
- use plain text to write that this section will show us where Worcester precincts and voting locations are.

```{r}
library(sf) #here we tell R that we need the Simple Features library (sf)
library(tmap)    # for static and interactive maps
library(leaflet) # for interactive maps
library(ggplot2) # tidyverse data visualization package

#then we create an object called "precs," which is short for precincts and fill it with the data from our geojson file
precs = read_sf("data/Voting_Precincts_Based_on_2020_Census_Data.geojson")

#the "head" function tells us what is in the object and what kind of object it is
head(precs)

#let's plot our object
tm_shape(precs) + 
  tm_fill()

#now let's try it with some borders
tm_shape(precs) + 
  tm_fill() +
  tm_borders()

#what about some labels?
tm_shape(precs) + 
  tm_fill() +
  tm_borders() +  
  tm_text()

#that didn't work? how do we learn more about our tm_* (tmap) functions?
?tmap

#R will let you make a map object and reuse it
woo_map1 = tm_shape(precs)+tm_fill()+tm_borders()

```

# Polling Stations 
Your task is to make a new section that imports the voting polling stations and places them on a map.
```{r}

```
#elections results
```{r}
library(dplyr)
results=read.csv("data/worc_23_election_atlarge.csv")

```
